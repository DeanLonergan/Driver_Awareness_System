# Driver_Awareness_System
My final year project; developed using Vector CANoe. My goal was to apply the principles of functional safety during the development of an automotive software component. The component, known as the Driver Awareness System, uses data from Car2X/V2X signals to enhance a driver's situational awareness and alert them of possible conflicts.
