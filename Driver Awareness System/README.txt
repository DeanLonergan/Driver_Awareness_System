To run the program, use CANoe to load the configuration file called "DriverAwarenessSystem.cfg", located in the "DAS" folder.

If you do not have CANoe, I have created a C file containing the code from the ECU of Car 1.
Keep in mind, the code is written in CAPL which, while similar, is not the same as C.
